The technology produces signal spectra that contain information about the chemical dissociation pattern of a peptide that was forced to fragment using methods like collision-induced dissociation. The ability to predict these MS2 signals and to understand this fragmentation process is important for sensitive high-throughput proteomics research.Results: We present a new tool called MS2PIP for predicting the intensity of the most important fragment ion signal peaks from a peptide sequence. MS2PIP pre-processes a large dataset with confident peptide-to-spectrum matches to facilitate data-driven model induction using a random forest regression learning algorithm. The intensity predictions of MS2PIP were evaluated on several independent evaluation sets and found to correlate significantly better with the observed fragment-ion intensities as compared with the current state-of-the-art PeptideART tool.Availability: MS2PIP code is available for both training and predicting at http://compomics.com/.Contact:  sven.degroeve@UGent.beSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the years, there has been notable progress in understanding the pathogenesis and treatment modalities of diabetes and its complications, including the application of metabolomics in the study of diabetes, capturing attention from researchers worldwide. Advanced mass spectrometry, including gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS), liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS), etc., has significantly broadened the spectrum of detectable metabolites, even at lower concentrations. Advanced mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful tool in diabetes research, particularly in the context of metabolomics. By leveraging the precision and sensitivity of advanced mass spectrometry techniques, researchers have unlocked a wealth of information within the metabolome. This technology has enabled the identification and quantification of potential biomarkers associated with diabetes and its complications, providing new ideas and methods for clinical diagnostics and metabolic studies. Moreover, it offers a less invasive, or even non-invasive, means of tracking disease progression, evaluating treatment efficacy, and understanding the underlying metabolic alterations in diabetes. This paper summarizes advanced mass spectrometry for the application of metabolomics in diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic encephalopathy, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and diabetic foot ulcers and organizes some of the potential biomarkers of the different complications with the aim of providing ideas and methods for subsequent in-depth metabolic research and searching for new ways of treating the disease.},

  abstract = "Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that
              each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled
              independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the
              forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a
              limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The
              generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on
              the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the
              correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to
              split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to
              Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings
              of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but
              are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor
              error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the
              response to increasing the number of features used in the
              splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable
              importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

abstract="Mass spectrometry is an important technique for analyzing proteins and other biomolecular compounds in biological samples. Each of the vendors of these mass spectrometers uses a different proprietary binary output file format, which has hindered data sharing and the development of open source software for downstream analysis. The solution has been to develop, with the full participation of academic researchers as well as software and hardware vendors, an open XML-based format for encoding mass spectrometer output files, and then to write software to use this format for archiving, sharing, and processing. This chapter presents the various components and information available for this format, mzML. In addition to the XML schema that defines the file structure, a controlled vocabulary provides clear terms and definitions for the spectral metadata, and a semantic validation rules mapping file allows the mzML semantic validator to insure that an mzML document complies with one of several levels of requirements. Complete documentation and example files insure that the format may be uniformly implemented. At the time of release, there already existed several implementations of the format and vendors have committed to supporting the format in their products.",

abstract="The shotgun proteomics strategy, based on digesting proteins into peptides and sequencing them using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), has become widely adopted. The identification of peptides from acquired MS/MS spectra is most often performed using the database search approach. We provide a detailed description of the peptide identification process and review the most commonly used database search programs. The appropriate choice of the search parameters and the sequence database are important for successful application of this method, and we provide general guidelines for carrying out efficient analysis of MS/MS data. We also discuss various reasons why database search tools fail to assign the correct sequence to many MS/MS spectra, and draw attention to the problem of false-positive identifications that can significantly diminish the value of published data. To assist in the evaluation of peptide assignments to MS/MS spectra, we review the scoring schemes implemented in most frequently used database search tools. We also describe statistical approaches and computational tools for validating peptide assignments to MS/MS spectra, including the concept of expectation values, reversed database searching, and the empirical Bayesian analysis of PeptideProphet. Finally, the process of inferring the identities of the sample proteins given the list of peptide identifications is outlined, and the limitations of shotgun proteomics with regard to discrimination between protein isoforms are discussed.",
