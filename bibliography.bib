ABSTRACT = {Over the years, there has been notable progress in understanding the pathogenesis and treatment modalities of diabetes and its complications, including the application of metabolomics in the study of diabetes, capturing attention from researchers worldwide. Advanced mass spectrometry, including gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS), liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS), etc., has significantly broadened the spectrum of detectable metabolites, even at lower concentrations. Advanced mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful tool in diabetes research, particularly in the context of metabolomics. By leveraging the precision and sensitivity of advanced mass spectrometry techniques, researchers have unlocked a wealth of information within the metabolome. This technology has enabled the identification and quantification of potential biomarkers associated with diabetes and its complications, providing new ideas and methods for clinical diagnostics and metabolic studies. Moreover, it offers a less invasive, or even non-invasive, means of tracking disease progression, evaluating treatment efficacy, and understanding the underlying metabolic alterations in diabetes. This paper summarizes advanced mass spectrometry for the application of metabolomics in diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic encephalopathy, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and diabetic foot ulcers and organizes some of the potential biomarkers of the different complications with the aim of providing ideas and methods for subsequent in-depth metabolic research and searching for new ways of treating the disease.},

abstract="The shotgun proteomics strategy, based on digesting proteins into peptides and sequencing them using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), has become widely adopted. The identification of peptides from acquired MS/MS spectra is most often performed using the database search approach. We provide a detailed description of the peptide identification process and review the most commonly used database search programs. The appropriate choice of the search parameters and the sequence database are important for successful application of this method, and we provide general guidelines for carrying out efficient analysis of MS/MS data. We also discuss various reasons why database search tools fail to assign the correct sequence to many MS/MS spectra, and draw attention to the problem of false-positive identifications that can significantly diminish the value of published data. To assist in the evaluation of peptide assignments to MS/MS spectra, we review the scoring schemes implemented in most frequently used database search tools. We also describe statistical approaches and computational tools for validating peptide assignments to MS/MS spectra, including the concept of expectation values, reversed database searching, and the empirical Bayesian analysis of PeptideProphet. Finally, the process of inferring the identities of the sample proteins given the list of peptide identifications is outlined, and the limitations of shotgun proteomics with regard to discrimination between protein isoforms are discussed.",
