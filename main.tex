\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Fundamentals}
Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a method for measuring the mass to charge ratios (m/z) of components in a  chemical substance sample and analysis of its molecules \cite{mass-specrometer}. MS has a variety of applications \cite{ms-applications} reaching from forensic analysis, where it is used to trace evidence , over environmental analysis, for example to keep track of pollution or test drinking water, to clinical purposes where MS is used for genomics research or diabetes research \cite{ms-diabetes}.
Before mass spectrometry can be performed, the sample has to be prepared meaning that it is turned into a state that is a valid input for the mass spectrometer. This is done by either converting it into a gas phase for Gas Chromatography or into a liquid phase for Liquid Chromatography. In Gas chromatography the molecular components are separated by vaporization and dilution of the sample on basis of attributes like weight, size, or boiling point. Liquid chromatography on the contrary separates components on basis of how fast they travel trough a liquid phase, this can be for example because of the difference of the polarity of the liquid phase and the components of the sample. Of course, the exact workflow is dependant on the Instrument that is used. Mass spectrometers exist in various variants e.G. MALDI-TOF MS, Triple Quadrupole MS, Hybrid Linear Ion Trap Orbitrap MS etc.  \cite{mass-specrometer-types} however regardless of their type they usually follow the same steps \cite{mass-specrometer, what-is-mass-spectrometry}: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item After the sample preparation, the sample is ionized, meaning that ions are generated. A common approach in gas chromatography is electron bombardement where the molecules are passed through a ionization chamber with accelerated electrons. The electrons collide with the molecules, break their bonds and turn them into fragments. A different approach in liquid
chromatography is electrospray chromatography where the liquidified sample is sprayed into an electric field where it evaporates.
\item The produced ions are sorted by their mass-to-charge ratios by a mass analyser. How this is done is dependant on the machine that is used.
\item After the sorting of the ions a detection system determines the relative abundances for each observed mass-to-charge (m/z) value.
\end{enumerate} 

The output is a mass spectrum which is a plot that yields the m/z values on the x-axis and the abundances on the y-axis. The m/z value is the mass of a particle divided by its electrical charge. The abundances are normalised to the highest abundance peak in the spectrum, meaning that the highest peak is 1 and all other peaks have a value relative to it [\cref{fig:peptide-example}]. 

Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS or \(MS^2\)) is used for the analysis of peptides and involves multiple stages, where in the first stage the entire sample is analysed with a mass spectrometer, then one ion is selected for further analysis and on the next stage only this isolated ion is analysed by another MS run \cite{tandem-mass-spectrometry}. 

Since every peptide sequence produces its own unique mass spectrum, it can be used as its unique fingerprint to identify it in a sample.

\end{figure}

Tandem MS searching is used for peptide identification within a mass spectrometry scan. Proteomics software that deals with the problem of identifying protein/peptide identification can fall into the category of database searching, where the search is performed against a database, and de novo searching, where peptides are deduced without a database.

\subsection{Motivation}
Comet is an open source proteomics Tandem MS/\(MS^2\) database search algorithm/tool written in C++ for searching spectrum data against sequence databases and identification of peptides, that in 2012 emerged from the SEQUEST database search tool from the University of Washington that was written in 1994 \cite{comet-search-tool}. It supports multithreading and is highly parametrizable. The tool computes multiple scores that evaluate how close a sample peptide is to the peptide it is compared to. One of these scores is the "xcorr". To calculate the xcorr value the algorithm constructs a spectrum from the peptide which is assumed to be the peptide of the sample by generating all possible m/z values from the 'b' and 'y' series of the peptide \cite{comet-first-paper}. Since in 1994 it was not entirely possible to predict the intensities of 'b' and 'y' ions, they are assigned the intensity of 1 \cite{deeper-look-into-comet}. Neighboring m/z values, meaning $\pm$1 m/z, receive an intensity of 0.5. With the sample spectrum and the constructed "theoretical" spectrum, a correlation based score is computed
to evaluate the fitting of the found peptide.

Peptide prediction algorithms are able to predict \(MS^2\) peaks with the help of various machine learning models.
MS2PIP\cite{ms2pip} is a command line peptide intensity prediction tool which also exposes a python API.

This work wants to combine the comet cross-correlation scoring algorithm
with the peptide intensity prediction of MS2PIP to create an even more accurate identification of peptides.


\subsection{Goals}
As comet is written in the C/C++ Programming Languages and MS2PIP is a Python Api, it is first of all necessary to translate the Comet cross-correlation scoring algorithm to the python programming language as accurately as possible. Next, the theoretical spectrum containing only m/z values without any abundances created by comet will be replaced by the predicted spectrum of MS2PIP. Performance regarding computational speed and identified peptides will be then compared to the initial comet algorithm, and the to python translated comet.
The goal of this work is to check whether replacing comets theoretical spectrum with the predicted spectrum of MS2PIP will yield better results in peptide identification, and with this, to find a new method of peptide identification.

\section{Methods and Structure}
\subsection{Realizing the Xcorr algorithm in Python}
For this work, Python is used as the Programming language. Before implementing, it is first necessary to have human genome data to work with. For this purpose, LFQ Orbitrap data was used as the sample, specifically in the mzml format which is a xml based format for storing mass spec scan data. The search is done against data of the human genome in the fasta format which stores protein primary structure and serves as the "database".

\subsubsection{Reading in Spectrum data}
Acessing these files with python was done with the help of the pyteomics framework \cite{pyteomics, pyteomics-five-years} which contains many tools for working with proteomics data. 

For efficient identification of peptides it is first necessary to create a compact list that contains all masses, and peptides that have this mass, from the fasta database file. In the following this list will be referred to as the "peptide index". While iterating through the fasta database, the retrieved sequences are \textit{in silico} digested, meaning that the function of the human digestive system is simulated. This is realized by cutting the sequences after the amino acids Arginie (R) and Lysine (K), except for those sites where R or K are followed by Proline (P). The general regulal expression for this is "(?$<$=[KR])(?!P)". In the human body peptides that are too large for the small intestine are cleaved by the enzyme trypsin, and are called "tryptic peptides". For every peptide that has been cleaved from a sequence from the fasta, its monoisotopic mass is calculated. This mass is added to a dictionary as the key if it does not exit yet, and the according peptide as the value. The static modification Carbamidomethylation of Cysteine (C) as well as the Oxidation of Methionine (M) have been taken into account. Since multiple peptides can have the same mass, it is possible that for a mass/key value are multiple peptides stored. Next, the dictionary is converted to list, which is sorted by the mass in ascending order [\cref{fig:peptindex}].

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/peptindex.png} 
\caption{Peptide index list generated from the fasta database file}
\label{fig:peptindex}
\end{wrapfigure}

\subsubsection{Identification}
After generating the peptide index list, a pool of user specified amount of processes is created. A manager from the python multiprocessing library is used to share the previously generated peptide index between the pool processes. 

The program starts iterating over the spectra inside the mzml sample file, and does so until all spectra are read. It loads user defined amount of spectra into a buffer, which is accessed by the process pool. A process loads one spectrum scan from the buffer and proceeds with the identification, meaning that the peptide index is searched for a possible close match for the spectrum.

It is first checked whether the MS level is 2, if it is the case, the program iterates over all possible precursors and selected ions, where is first calculates the mass in dalton of the selected ion.

The program proceeds with a rough filter of peptides that can come into question for the given scan. This is done by a lookup into the peptide index where it is searched for peptides that have a mass close to the mass of the selected precursor ion. The tolerance for a canditate peptide is 20 parts per million (ppm), that means between a mass of $\pm$ spectrum mass * 0.00002.

The lower and upper bounds are first calculated. The peptide index is a list meaning that it is indexable, and the masses are sorted in ascending order, that means that it is possible to efficiently get the upper and lower indices of the peptide index entries by binary searching the list. A binary search function is searching for the lower index of the peptide list first, and returns the first index of the list where the mass is $\ge$ the calculated lower bound. The upper index is searched the same way. After getting the upper and lower indices, the process gets a slice from the peptide index including all peptides that are possible candidates for scoring. E.g if the lower bound for the mass is 1033.6777 and the upper bound is 2190.5454,
the slice would be between the second line and the last line in \cref{fig:peptindex}.


\subsubsection{CLI}
To make usage comfortable, a CLI is implemented. This was done with the help of the Typer library. The general usage is "cli.py [OPTIONS] SAMPLE\_FILENAME PROTEIN\_DATABASE" in the terminal, where "SAMPLE\_FILENAME" is a required argument and placeholder for the sample filename in the mzml format as a string, and "PROTEIN\_DATABASE" the string for the database filename of the human genome respectively. 

The CLI provides additionally three options: The "--p" flag followed by an integer sets the amount of processes to use for multiprocessed identification. If this flag is not set, the program works with a default value of cpu\_count()-2, where cpu\_count() returns the amount of processes the used machine can provide. The "--s" flag followed by an integer specifies the amount of spectra that the processes load and buffers at a time. The default amount is 5000. If the "--ps" flag is set, the program will work with the predicted spectra instead of the theoretical ones.
