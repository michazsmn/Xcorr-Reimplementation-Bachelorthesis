\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
\(MS^2\) Database searching is a method for peptide identification within a Mass Spectrometry Scan. Proteomics software
that deals with the problem of identifying protein/peptide identification can fall into the category of database searching,
where the search is performed against a database, and de novo searching, where peptides are deduced without a database.

Comet is an open source proteomics database search algorithm/tool for searching spectrum data against sequence databases and identification of peptides, that emerged from the SEQUEST database search tool from the University of Washington in 2012 \cite{comet-search-tool}.The algorithm 
constructs a spectrum from the peptide which is assumed to be the peptide
of the sample by generating all possible m/z values from the 'b' and 'y' series of the peptide \cite{comet-first-paper}.  Since it is not entirely possible to predict the intensities of 'b' and 'y' ions, they are assigned the intensity of 1. Neighboring m/z values, meaning $\pm$1 m/z, receive an intensity of 0.5. With the sample spectrum and the constructed "theoretical" spectrum, a correlation based score is computed
to evaluate the fitting of the found peptide.

Peptide prediction algorithms are able to predict \(MS^2\) peaks E.g. MS2PIP\cite{ms2pip}.
